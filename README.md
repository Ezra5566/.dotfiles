Hereâ€™s the code version of your terminal setup and configuration in a `README.md` format:

This repository contains my configuration files for setting up a development and cybersecurity environment on a Chromebook using Kali Linux. Below is a breakdown of my setup process and configuration.

## 1. Terminal Configuration

### Switching from Debian to Kali Linux

I initially set up Kali Linux on my Chromebook, which uses Debian (Bookworm) by default.

```bash
# 1. Edit the sources list to include Kali repositories
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Change the contents to:
```plaintext
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
```
Comment out the default Debian sources.

```bash
# 2. Add the Kali software key
sudo wget https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kali-archive-keyring.asc
```

```bash
# 3. Update and upgrade your system to Kali
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt install kali-defaults
```

### Setting Up the Terminal

#### Install Warp Terminal and Starship Prompt

```bash
# 1. Install Starship at the root to avoid entering the root password
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# 2. Configure Starship in your .bashrc
eval "$(starship init bash)"
```

```bash
# 3. Create the Starship configuration file
mkdir -p ~/.config && touch ~/.config/starship.toml
```
Customize your `starship.toml` as needed.

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install essential tools for development and cybersecurity
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
  fzf \
  btop \
  bat \
  eza \
  nodejs \
  npm \
  yarn \
  git \
  gh \
  zoxide \
  curl \
  wget \
  ripgrep \
  fastfetch \
  build-essential \
  python3 \
  python3-pip \
  xclip
```

## 2. Other Configurations and Installations

### Eza
To install `eza` (an improved version of `ls`):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gpg
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eza-community/eza/main/deb.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/gierens.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/gierens.gpg] http://deb.gierens.de stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gierens.list
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/keyrings/gierens.gpg /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gierens.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y eza
```

### Lazygit
```bash
# Download and install lazygit
wget https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/download/v0.43.1/lazygit_0.43.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvf lazygit_0.43.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv lazygit /usr/local/bin/
rm lazygit_0.43.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz

# Verify installation
lazygit --version
```

### Super File
Install `Super File`:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sLo- https://superfile.netlify.app/install.sh)"
```

### Oh My Posh (for Nerd Fonts)
```bash
# Install oh-my-posh for Nerd Fonts
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s
```

### Configure Nerd Fonts on Default Terminal
Ensure your terminal is set to use Nerd Fonts for optimal visual display of prompts.

### Bat
Set up `bat`:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s /usr/bin/batcat ~/.local/bin/bat
```

### Git Configuration
Set up individual git configurations based on your personal preferences.
